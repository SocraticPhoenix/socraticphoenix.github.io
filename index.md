# About Me
Hi, I'm John-Ryan Dunn (also known as SocraticPhoenix). I'm currently a computer science undergrad and a Java enthusiast. 
My hobby interests in the field include programming language design and occasionally game design.

### GitHub Projects
I have organized my GitHub projects into multiple organizations, mostly for my own sanity. The [repositories](https://github.com/SocraticPhoenix?tab=repositories)
on my account page are mostly short term hobby projects. The majority of them are buggy, poorly documented,
and were only written out of my own curiosity and interest. 

---

The repositories in my [HoneyRoasted](https://github.com/HoneyRoasted) organization are my different projects revolving around programming
language design, and I am making an effort to keep them highly documented and well tested. There are still a few repositories
there that are from older projects, but I am working on updating them. I have a [GitHub Pages Site](https://honeyroasted.github.io/)
up for the Honey Roasted organization. The projects listed on that page will be the ones that are most up-to-date and well-documented.

The repositories in my [PlutoPowered](https://github.com/PlutoPowered) organization are my different projects revolving around game design.
It is currently empty.  

---
The repositories in my [Randores](https://github.com/Randores) organization are all part of an older project of mine (last updated 2017),
a rather large minecraft mode available on [curse forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/socraticsrandores).
I have since stopped development, but I leave the code up in case anyone wants to look at it, and in case I ever want to re-visit it.
