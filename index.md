# About Me
Hi, I'm John-Ryan Dunn (also known as SocraticPhoenix). I'm currently a backend Java software engineer. 
My hobby interests in the field include programming language design and occasionally game design.

### Portfolio Highlights
A large number of projects on my GitHub are WIP, old, and/or poorly documented. I keep most of them
around in case I ever want to revisit or reference them. Here are some projects I'm actually proud of:

- [HoneyRoasted](https://honey-roasted.com/) - My current hobby project is an attempt to write my own Java compiler. I have been working on [Jype](https://honey-roasted.com/jype/landing), the type system implementation, on and off for the past few years. A lot of the code is still a bit disorganized and heavily WIP, but it is my largest active hobby project.
- [Fill](https://honey-roasted.com/fill/landing) - Of the projects in my HoneyRoasted organization, Fill is the most complete and well documented. It is a simple Java injection library. I created it mostly to showcase and test my work on Jype.
- [Randores](https://github.com/Randores/Randores) - A minecraft mod I created that gained some traction and actually had quite a few downloads (~30k). I am not particularly proud of the code anymore, but out of all my projects it is the one that gained the most public interest.
- [TioJ](https://github.com/SocraticPhoenix/TioJ) and [TioBot](https://github.com/SocraticPhoenix/TioBot) - [tio.run](https://tio.run/#) is a website created by another developer (not me), that allows users to execute code in almost any programming language online. It also has a Web API. I wrote a library (TioJ) for accessing that API, as well as a stack exchange chat room bot for executing code using the library. These projects are a bit out of date, but they are the first projects I published that I am still pretty happy with.

### GitHub Projects
I have organized my GitHub projects into multiple organizations, mostly for my own sanity. The [repositories](https://github.com/SocraticPhoenix?tab=repositories)
on my account page are mostly short term hobby projects. The majority of them are buggy, poorly documented,
and were only written out of my own curiosity and interest. 

---

The repositories in my [HoneyRoasted](https://github.com/HoneyRoasted) organization are my different projects revolving around programming
language design. I have a [GitHub Pages Site](https://honeyroasted.github.io/)
up for the Honey Roasted organization.

---

The repositories in my [PlutoPowered](https://github.com/PlutoPowered) organization are my different projects revolving around game design.
It is currently empty.  

---
The repositories in my [Randores](https://github.com/Randores) organization are all part of an older project of mine (last updated 2017),
a rather large minecraft mode available on [curse forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/socraticsrandores).
I have since stopped development, but I leave the code up in case anyone wants to look at it, and in case I ever want to re-visit it.
